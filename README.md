Notes
This application, however, has gone through a couple of changes for improved usability and structure. We included the EJS templating engine for more versatile content and removed any static ‘res.sendFile’ calls for routes in favor of ‘res.render’. We created a ‘getArticlesWithCategoryNames’ function that would enable users to easily find articles related to particular categories by mapping the former to the corresponding category names. We also implemented the ‘getArticleById’ function to handle cases when it is necessary to retrieve and display a particular article. In the cases when the article has not been published, a 404 page will appear. Furthermore, routes were extended with additional logic that provided more control over errors, and a .gitignore file was made to prevent node_modules from being published. Last but not least, Bootstrap contributed significantly to UI, adding features that enhanced the look and feel of the interface while improving usability.
